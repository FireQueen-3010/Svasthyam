             <h2>Brocoli and Salad?</h2>

             <h2>Will greek yoghurt help gaining weight?</h2>
             <p>To make yoghurt, milk is fermented with live cultures of beneficial bacteria. Greek yoghurt contains less sugar than regular yoghurt. When the whey is removed, the yoghurt becomes thicker, creamier, and tarter.
Some manufacturers thicken regular yoghurt and sell it as "Greek-style," which may not have the same health benefits as Greek yoghurt. Furthermore, low-fat or no-fat Greek yoghurt may not provide the same health benefits as traditional Greek yoghurt. Greek yoghurt may be beneficial to one's health due to the nutrients it contains, which include:

calcium

protein

probiotics

iodine

B-12 vitamin.</p>

             <h2>Is salmon good for heart?</h2>
             <p>Salmon is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce inflammation and are important for tissue health, according to Meyer-Jax. It's also high in protein, with a 3.5-ounce serving containing about 20 grammes. Protein aids in the growth and repair of muscles and tissues. Salmon is high in protein, which is important for bone health, preventing muscle loss, and assisting the body in healing and repair. Its high astaxanthin content may help to maintain skin elasticity, reduce ageing signs, and protect the skin from UV damage.</p>
